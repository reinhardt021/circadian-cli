# CIRCADIAN CLI

Pomodoro in the command line

## Dependencies

* Ruby version 3.0.2

## TODO:

* [ ] 

this might not work anymore as the commandline cannot simultaneously output and take input
at least not in ruby
need something that can run int he background or separately

instead we can work on something else today
maybe worth trying to build the three js next time

or maybe something else like
the chrome extension?
